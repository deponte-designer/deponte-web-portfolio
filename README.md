# dePonte Web Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my work and providing information about me.


## Description about me

Hello, I'm Sofia, and I'm on a journey of reinvention and exploration. 

With a Bachelor's degree in Design and a decade of experience in both the private and public sectors, I've honed my creative and problem-solving skills. My work as a designer has allowed me to tackle a wide range of challenges, from crafting captivating visuals to designing user-friendly interfaces.

My career path has led me to the United Kingdom, and I've decided to embark on an exciting new adventure - a career change into the world of web development. I'm currently enrolled in a Front-End Web Development bootcamp, where I'm immersing myself in the world of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and learning to transform ideas into interactive digital experiences.

My journey is marked by a passion for design, a dedication to continuous learning, and an unquenchable curiosity about the ever-evolving tech landscape. I'm eager to leverage my unique blend of skills and experiences in the web development field and contribute to innovative projects and teams.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss collaboration opportunities, share insights, or just have a good tech chat.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
